			<h3 class="first">Mental Health Awareness was established to educate the public about mental illness, raise public awareness about research and treatments, decrease the stigma associated with mental illness, and commemorate mental illness healing. People frequently suffer in silence and may not seek treatment for their problems due to myths and stigma around mental health difficulties. Mental health awareness is a critical project for increasing understanding of mental health disorders and increasing access to healthcare for those in need.</h3>
			<h3 class="second">Whether or not a person has a mental health problem, Mental Health Awareness helps people acknowledge how mental illness affects their life, informs them about available resources, and emphasizes methods to advocate.
			Recognition and education are major elements in removing the stigma that surrounds mental illness. Mental Health Awarenessprovides an opportunity to start a communication. Talking honestly about mental health may help to dispel myths and stigma, as well as urge individuals in need to get treatment and establish a support network.</h3>
			<h3 class="third">Mental Health Awareness helps those with a condition overcome the stigma and get access to treatment. It helps their friends, family, and loved ones better understand their condition and connect with support networks. It helps the providers who treat those with a condition receive funding for their research and treatment so they can better care for all our mental health. In short, we can all benefit from Mental Health Awareness.</h3>

			<h3 class="suicidal">Suicidal Ideation:</h3>
			<p class="sssd">Suicidal thoughts or ideas are a wide phrase used to represent a variety of thoughts, wishes, and preoccupations with death and suicide. Because there is no globally acknowledged uniform definition of SI, doctors, researchers, and educators face continual issues. In research projects, for example, SI is commonly given distinct operational meanings. This impairs the capacity to compare data across research and is commonly cited as a drawback in meta-analyses of suicidality. Suicide planning deliberations are included in some SI definitions, while others consider planning to be a distinct stage.</p>
