	<h3 class="content1"> Mental Health is a broad term that includes anything to do with our mind - the seat of behavior, emotions, and thinking. Mental well-being is simply when all the previously mentioned characteristics seated in the mind are working in tandem, or in harmony. It is also sometimes known as "mental hygiene". When we behave well, when we think positively, and when we experience and express good and positive emotions, then our mental well-being is being achieved. This also leads to having a fuller and more satisfying physical health. The following are some do's and dont's that will help you improve your mental well-being. This list is not exhaustive, but by practicing even some of the tips, your life will become happier and satisfying.</h3>

	<h4 class="num2"> 2. IDENTIFY YOUR STRENGTHS AS WELL AS WEAKNESSES </h4>
	<p class="second1"> Knowing what you can excel at enables you to aim higher and achieve much more. Knowing your weaknesses gives you a clearer understanding of things that may be holding you back, and you can then work around finding ways to not let your weaknesses pull you behind.</p>

	<h4 class="num3"> 3. ACCEPT AND VALUE YOURSELF FOR WHAT YOU ARE </h4>
	<p class="third1"> Determine and live your personal values. </p>

	<p class="fourth"> Being physically active can help you lead a healthier and happier life. </p>

	<h4 class="num5"> 5. DEVELOP SOME INTERESTS OR HOBBIES IN LIFE </h4>

	<h3 class="content3"> THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT DO TO IMPROVE YOUR MENTAL WELL-BEING </h3>
</div>

<h4 class="num8"> 1. DON'T REMAIN IDLE </h4>
	<p class="first2"> Spend your free time with your family and friends. This will give you joy and help you keep mentally stable. </p>

	<h4 class="num12"> 5. DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF WITH OTHERS </h4>
